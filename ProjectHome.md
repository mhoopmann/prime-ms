Parallel reaction monitoring offers advantages over selected reaction monitoring for detection and quantitation of peptides in targeted studies through the simultaneous observation of all peptide transitions. PRiMe is a novel tool with an intuitive graphical user interface for the analysis of parallel reaction monitoring data and subsequent relative quantitation of peptides and proteins across multiple samples.

PRiMe is currently in alpha/testing stages and some features are finicky due to development. A development binary version is available:
